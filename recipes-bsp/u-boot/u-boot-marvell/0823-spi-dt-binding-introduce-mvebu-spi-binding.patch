+Marvell SPI binding
+===================
+
+Binding for SPI Driver Marvell's Armada familiy SoCs (Apart from A37x0).
+
+Mandatory properties:
+SoC specific:
+- compatible: 		Should be one of the following options:
+				"marvell,armada-375-spi"
+				"marvell,armada-380-spi"
+				"marvell,armada-xp-spi"
+- reg:			Base address of SPI host controllers
+- clocks:		This property points to the used clock for the SPI interface.
+- cell-index:		SPI unit id.
+- #address-cells: 	Must be <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
+- #size-cells:		Must be <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.
+
+
+Board specific:
+- spi-max-frequency:	SPI max bus frequency.
+
+Example: For SPI-0 node:
+	cpm_spi0: spi@700600 {
+		compatible = "marvell,armada-380-spi";
+			reg = <0x700600 0x50>;
+			#address-cells = <0x1>;
+			#size-cells = <0x0>;
+			cell-index = <1>;
+			clocks = <&cpm_syscon0 0 3>;
+	};
